        <p id="paragraph"> JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class
          functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser
          environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports
          object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
          JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave
          on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely
          used for controlling web page behavior.
          Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". In a nutshell, JavaScript is a
          dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally
          similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language. Language
          constructs, such as if statements, for and while loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same
          as in these languages (or nearly so).
          JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created
          programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as
          opposed to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has
          been constructed it can be used as a blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.
          JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function
          variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for ... in), and source code recovery
          (JavaScript programs can decompile function bodies back into their source text).
